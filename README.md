# ‚òï Exploring Coffee Quality Data with Power BI

Welcome to my coffee quality data analysis project! This repository showcases an in-depth exploration of factors influencing coffee quality using data from the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)**. By leveraging **Power BI**, I conducted a detailed analysis to uncover key trends, correlations, and insights in the world of coffee.

## üåü Project Overview

This project dives into the sensory and processing attributes that affect coffee quality, with the aim to support coffee growers, roasters, and buyers in making data-informed decisions to improve quality and consistency.

## üîç Objectives

- **Identify** the main sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.) contributing to coffee quality.
- **Explore correlations** between processing methods, origin regions, and quality scores.
- **Uncover defect trends** and their impact on overall coffee quality.
- **Analyze interactions** among various attributes that affect Total Cup Points, an overall measure of coffee quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualizations.
- **Power Query Editor**: To preprocess data and ensure consistency in formatting.
- **What-If Analysis**: To simulate different scenarios and assess potential impacts on Total Cup Points.

## üìà Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - Imported and cleaned the `df_arabica_clean.csv` dataset using **Power Query Editor**.
   - Standardized date formats, removed irrelevant columns, and handled missing values.
  
2. **Data Analysis & Visualization**:
   - Created separate Power BI report pages for each research question, each featuring 3-4 visuals with relevant slicers.
   - Utilized clustered column charts, scatter plots, and line charts for a clear representation of trends.
   - Added tooltips for in-depth, on-hover data insights.

3. **Key Analytical Techniques**:
   - Conducted **What-If Analysis** to model potential scenarios affecting Total Cup Points.
   - Implemented interactive filtering through slicers, allowing focused analysis by region, processing method, and harvest year.

## üåê Insights & Impact

This analysis enables a better understanding of factors influencing coffee quality and supports sustainable practices by helping growers improve quality. Key insights include:
- A deeper understanding of the interplay between sensory attributes and quality scores.
- Insight into how different processing methods influence coffee's flavor profile.
- Identification of defect patterns and their impact on overall quality scores.



## üìö Lessons Learned

- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced skills in visual storytelling and data representation in Power BI.
- **Data Preparation**: Gained experience in data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Developed a structured approach to answering complex research questions using quantifiable metrics.

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Expand to additional datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast quality based on processing conditions.
